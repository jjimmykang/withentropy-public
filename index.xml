      <description>Absolutely within ten years, all of us will be conversing with AI more than with other people. The topic of AI and its impact on jobs and market capitalizations and whatever have been beat to death, but I think this point is flying over the head of the average person.
I&amp;rsquo;m certain that in ten years, coming home from work will look more like Blade Runner 2049 than anything else. Less sex and Ana de Armas, but the core concept will remain the same.</description>

      <description>My college physical life was a bit strange. I worked out(weights) nearly every day, except that I basically didn&amp;rsquo;t move from my chair at any other point in time. Food was a block away, and I nearly never went to class. The few times I did, I would use an electric scooter. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t like I was a health nut, but I generally kept my weight between 175-180lb as a 6&#39;0 male.</description>

      <description>I think my base nature is to not be appreciative of the things I truly have. Every day, I think about the things that I could be doing. I could be slaving away at an art school, working to perfect my craft to create my masterpiece someday. I could be doing a PhD, serving my years to be part of the AI revolution that&amp;rsquo;s hopefully coming. I could be a writer, searching for some type of meaning that I could impart on my readers.</description>
